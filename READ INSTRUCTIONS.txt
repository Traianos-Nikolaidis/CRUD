1. In a terminal inside the project run the command "composer install".

2.  Find the database folder and look for the file person.sqlite and copy the path (absolute path), if the file doesn't exist create it.
    Go to .env file and do the following:
        ...
        APP_URL=https://myURLexample.com
        ...
        DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
        DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=/example/folder/file.sqlite  (this is the path you got from above)
        DB_USERNAME=root
        DB_PASSWORD=

3.  Run the command "php artisan serve" and press Ctrl+click on the link provided by laravel.
